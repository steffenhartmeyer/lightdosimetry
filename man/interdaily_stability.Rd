\title{Interdaily stability (IS)}
\usage{
interdaily_stability(lightVar, dtVar, na.rm = TRUE, as_df = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lightVar}{Numeric vector containing the light data.}

\item{dtVar}{Vector containing the time data. Can be POSIXct or numeric.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{as_df}{Logical. Should the output be returned as a data frame? Defaults
to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Single column data frame or vector.
}
\description{
This function calculates the variability of 24h light exposure patterns across
multiple days. Calculated as the ratio of the variance of the average daily
pattern to the total variance across all days. Calculated for mean hourly
light levels. Ranges between 0 (Gaussian noise) and 1 (Perfect Stability).
