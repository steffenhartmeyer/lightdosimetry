\title{Light Quality Index}
\usage{
lqi(lightVar, upper = 500, lower = 10, sampling_int = 60, as_df = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lightVar}{Numeric vector containing the light data.}

\item{upper}{Single numeric value specifying the threshold of the bright light
level. Defaults to 500 lx as described in Martinez-Nicolas et al. (2011).}

\item{lower}{Single numeric value specifying the threshold of the dark light
level. Defaults to 10 lx as described in Martinez-Nicolas et al. (2011).}

\item{sampling_int}{Numeric. Sampling interval in seconds. Defaults to 60.}

\item{as_df}{Logical. Should the output be returned as a data frame? Defaults
to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Data frame or numeric vector.
}
\description{
This function calculates the light quality index as described in Martinez-Nicolas
et al. (2011).
}
\details{
Should be calculated for the period from waking up to going to bed.
   Default threshold values are provided in photopic illuminance as per the
   original paper. To calculate the original metric make sure that
   `lightVar` is photopic illuminance.
